/**
 *
 * Please ensure that ``static_save`` is set to ``false`` for your entity.
 *
 * This class has 2 primary functions:
 *
 * 1.) It is compensating for nodes not having any animation properties.
 * Yes, you can have a node with a mesh. But this is static. I do understand that
 * this is a reasonably difficult thing to implement. So I am just rolling with it.
 *
 * 2.) It is compensating for entities not having UUIDs. So basically, the entity has to
 * have ``static_save`` set to false. Unless you like having a very laggy game of course.
 * There is no way to realistically track entities that are on disk but not in the world.
 * I could probably do this, but, it would suffer from race conditions and all kinds of nonsense.
 * People have been trying to stop UUIDs for entities from being implemented into the game.
 * So if you think this is a shitty implementation, go argue with them in the IRC or Github issue
 * tracker. Thank you for understanding.
 *
 * This class will do automatic type inferrence, so you only need to pass the class the entity class.
 * The rest of the type information will be handled for you.
